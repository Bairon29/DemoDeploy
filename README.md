# DemoDeploy

## Fork The Repo

- Go to https://github.com/heidipowers/DemoDeploy and fork this repository to your personal github.
- Go to the new forked repo in **YOUR** github account and clone **YOUR** version of the DemoDeploy repo.

## Clone The Repo

- In your terminal, navigate to your code folder and cd into it. **DO NOT GO INTO YOUR WDI FOLDER!**
- Once inside your code folder (NOT WDI), type ``git clone`` and then paste the SSH code you copied from github. Hit Enter.
- In your terminal, type 'ls' and make sure the DemoDeploy folder is listed, then cd into it.
- Once inside your DemoDeploy folder, you should see that you are on the master branch and all the files from the cloned repo are inside the folder.
- Celebrate!

## Tell Github Your gitHub Pages Source

Github lets you choose which branch hosts your gitHub pages. We're going to set our source to the master branch.

- Go back to your github account in the Browser and enter your DemoDeploy repo.
- Inside the DemoDeploy repo, click **SETTINGS** from the top menu tabs on the right.
- You are now automatically located in the **OPTIONS** part of Settings (you can see the side menu to the left). Scroll down the page until you come the section titled, **gitHub Pages**.
- From the **SOURCE** dropdown, choose the master branch option and hit save.
- Celebrate!

## Let's Update our Pages

- Go back to your terminal. Make sure your file path is still inside your code/DemoDeploy folder.
- Type subl . to open your files (or whatever the command is for your text editor).
- Update your index.html by putting your name in the ```title``` tag. Save, add, commit, and push to origin master.
- Return to the browser window -- the gitHub settings page should still be there. Scroll to the the  **gitHub Pages** section and look for a green bar at the top that says, "Your site is published at:....". Click the link, or copy to a new window.
- If you did everything correct, your page will now be visible, with the title of your name.
- Celebrate!

*Donâ€™t worry if it takes a few minutes for the page to show up because there may be a delay up to ten minutes the first time you push the files to GitHub.*
