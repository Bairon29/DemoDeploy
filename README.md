## Tell Github Your Source

Github lets you choose which branch hosts your gitHub pages. We're going to set our source to the master branch.

- Go back to your github account and enter the DemoDeploy repo.
- Inside the DemoDeploy repo, click SETTINGS from the top menu tabs on the right.
- You are now automatically located in the OPTIONS part of Settings (you can see the side menu to the left). Scroll down the page until you come the section titled, 'gitHub Pages'.
- From the SOURCE dropdown, choose the master branch option.
- Celebrate!

## Let's Update our Pages

- Make sure your terminal is still inside your code/DemoDeploy folder.
- Type subl . to open your files, or whatever the command is for your text editor.
- Go into index.html, and put your name in the ```title``` tag.
